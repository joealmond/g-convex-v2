## Overview

G-Matrix rates products on **three dimensions**:

| Dimension | Method | Stored On Product | Computed Score |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Safety** | Per-allergen thumbs 👍/👎 | `allergenScores` (map) | 0–100 per allergen |
| **Taste** | Single thumbs 👍/👎 | `tasteUpVotes`, `tasteDownVotes` | 0–100 ratio |
| **Price** | 1–5 subjective scale + optional exact price | `avgPrice`, `exactPrices` | 1–5 average |

All scores use **Bayesian updating** — AI analysis seeds a prior (virtual votes), and community thumbs votes shift the score over time. With enough community votes, the AI prior becomes negligible.

---

## Dimensions

### Safety (Per-Allergen)

Unlike traditional single-score safety ratings, G-Matrix tracks safety **per allergen**. A product may be safe for someone avoiding gluten but unsafe for someone avoiding milk.

**Tracked allergens** (defined in `appConfig.allergens`):
| ID | Label | Emoji |
|----|-------|-------|
| `gluten` | Gluten | 🌾 |
| `milk` | Milk & Dairy | 🥛 |
| `soy` | Soy | 🫘 |
| `nuts` | Nuts | 🥜 |
| `eggs` | Eggs | 🥚 |

Each allergen has an independent score composed of:
- **AI base classification**: `contains` / `free-from` / `unknown` (set at product creation from ingredient analysis)
- **Community votes**: aggregated thumbs up/down from all users

### Taste

A single binary dimension. Users vote 👍 or 👎 on taste. The score is a ratio of positive votes with a neutral Bayesian prior.

### Price

Two components:
1. **Subjective scale** (1–5): Budget → Fair → Moderate → Premium → Luxury
2. **Exact price** (optional): Amount + currency code (e.g., `{ amount: 4.99, currency: "EUR" }`)

---

## Per-Allergen Safety Scoring

### The Bayesian Formula

For each allergen on a product:

```
score = (virtualUp + communityUp) / (virtualUp + virtualDown + communityUp + communityDown) × 100
```

### AI Virtual Votes (Prior)

The AI classification sets **virtual votes** that act as a Bayesian prior:

| AI Classification | Virtual 👍 | Virtual 👎 | Initial Score |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| `free-from` | 2 | 0 | **100** |
| `contains` | 0 | 2 | **0** |
| `unknown` | 1 | 1 | **50** |

These virtual votes are **never removed** — they're baked into the formula. As community votes accumulate, the virtual votes become proportionally less significant.

### How AI Classification Works

When a product is created:
1. **AI analyzes ingredients** (text/image OCR → ingredient list)
2. For each known allergen:
   - If allergen appears in `product.allergens` → `contains`
   - If allergen appears in `product.freeFrom` → `free-from`
   - Otherwise → `unknown`
3. `buildInitialAllergenScores()` creates the initial `allergenScores` map

**Example** — A product with `allergens: ["gluten"]` and `freeFrom: ["milk", "soy"]`:
```
{
  "gluten": { aiBase: "contains",  upVotes: 0, downVotes: 0 },  // score = 0
  "milk":   { aiBase: "free-from", upVotes: 0, downVotes: 0 },  // score = 100
  "soy":    { aiBase: "free-from", upVotes: 0, downVotes: 0 },  // score = 100
  "nuts":   { aiBase: "unknown",   upVotes: 0, downVotes: 0 },  // score = 50
  "eggs":   { aiBase: "unknown",   upVotes: 0, downVotes: 0 },  // score = 50
}
```

### Community Overrides AI

The Bayesian model means community votes can **override** the AI classification:

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| AI says `contains` + 15 users vote 👍, 2 vote 👎 | Score ≈ 79 (community overrides) |
| AI says `free-from` + 0 users vote 👍, 5 vote 👎 | Score ≈ 29 (community flags issue) |
| AI says `unknown` + 10 users vote 👍 | Score ≈ 92 (community establishes safety) |

This handles real-world edge cases:
- AI mistakes a "may contain" warning for actual allergen content
- Products reformulated after initial AI analysis
- AI misses a cross-contamination risk that users notice

---

## Taste Scoring

### Formula

```
score = (1 + upVotes) / (2 + upVotes + downVotes) × 100
```

Uses **1 virtual 👍 + 1 virtual 👎** as prior → starts at exactly **50** with 0 votes.

### Examples

| Up Votes | Down Votes | Score |
|----------|------------|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 50 |
| 1 | 0 | 67 |
| 5 | 0 | 86 |
| 5 | 5 | 50 |
| 0 | 5 | 14 |
| 20 | 3 | 84 |

---

## Price Scoring

### Subjective Scale

Users select one of 5 preset levels:

| Level | Label | Emoji | Internal Value |
|-------|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Budget | $ | 1 |
| 2 | Fair | $$ | 2 |
| 3 | Moderate | $$$ | 3 |
| 4 | Premium | $$$$ | 4 |
| 5 | Luxury | $$$$$ | 5 |

Product's `avgPrice` is the simple average of all vote prices.

### Exact Price (Optional)

Users can optionally enter an exact price (e.g., `€4.99`). These are stored in `product.exactPrices` as an array of `{ amount, currency, storeName? }` for price comparison features.

---

## Vote Lifecycle

### 1. Product Creation

```
AI analysis → buildInitialAllergenScores(allergens, freeFrom, knownIds)
           → Product created with allergenScores, averageSafety, averageTaste
```

`averageSafety` = universal worst-case (min of all allergen scores)
`averageTaste` = 50 (no votes yet)

### 2. User Casts Vote

A vote payload (`ThumbsVotePayload`) contains:
```typescript
{
  allergenVotes: { "gluten": "up", "milk": "down" },  // Per-allergen thumbs
  tasteVote: "up",                                      // Taste thumb
  price: 3,                                             // Price scale 1-5
  exactPrice: { amount: 4.99, currency: "EUR" },        // Optional
  storeName: "Aldi",                                     // Optional
}
```

All fields except at least one vote are optional — users don't have to vote on everything.

### 3. Recalculation

After each vote, `recalculateProduct()` runs:
1. Fetches **all votes** for the product
2. `aggregateAllergenVotes()` — counts per-allergen up/down from all votes (preserves AI base)
3. `aggregateTasteVotes()` — counts taste up/down (handles legacy numeric taste too)
4. Computes `computeAllergenScore()` for each allergen → updates `allergenScores`
5. `computeUniversalSafety()` → updates `averageSafety`
6. `computeTasteScore()` → updates `averageTaste`
7. Price average → updates `avgPrice`
8. Exact prices → appends to `exactPrices`

### 4. "I Agree" Quick Vote

If a user agrees with the current AI classification, they can tap "I Agree" which:
- For each allergen:
  - `contains` → votes 👎 (agrees the allergen is present)
  - `free-from` → votes 👍 (agrees the product is safe)
  - `unknown` → skipped (no opinion)
- Taste: 👍

This provides a low-friction way to reinforce AI results.

---

## Personalized Safety

Each user has a **dietary profile** listing their avoided allergens (e.g., `["gluten", "milk"]`).

### Computation

```
personalizedSafety = MIN(allergenScore for each allergen in user.avoidedAllergens)
```

**Logic**:
1. For each allergen in user's `avoidedAllergens` → compute that allergen's score
2. Return the **minimum** (worst-case = the user's limiting allergen)
3. If user has no dietary profile (empty array) → fall through to universal safety
4. If product has no `allergenScores` data → return 50 (unknown)

### Why Minimum?

If a product is 100% safe for gluten (score=98) but risky for milk (score=15), a user avoiding both should see **15** — the milk contamination is the bottleneck.

### Display

- **RatingBars** shows personalized safety with label "Safety — Safe for you" when personalized
- **VotingSheet** shows per-allergen scores with individual score bars
- **Feed cards** use `averageSafety` (universal) for consistent sorting

---

## Universal Safety

Used for **non-personalized contexts** (feed sorting, chart default, anonymous users):

```
universalSafety = MIN(allergenScore for ALL allergens on the product)
```

Stored as `product.averageSafety` for backward-compatible indexing and sorting.

---

## Legacy Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility with old votes that used numeric `safety` (0-100) and `taste` (0-100) fields:

### Vote Migration

- Old votes have `safety: number` + `taste: number` but no `allergenVotes` or `tasteVote`
- `aggregateAllergenVotes()` handles legacy: if a vote has `safety > 50` and no `allergenVotes`, counts as 👍 for `gluten` (primary allergen); `safety ≤ 50` → 👎 for `gluten`
- `aggregateTasteVotes()` handles legacy: `taste > 50` → 👍; `taste ≤ 50` → 👎

### Schema

Legacy fields are now `v.optional()`:
```typescript
safety: v.optional(v.number()),  // 0-100 — LEGACY
taste: v.optional(v.number()),   // 0-100 — LEGACY
```

New votes populate `allergenVotes` and `tasteVote` instead. Both old and new votes coexist in the same table and are aggregated together during recalculation.

## Math Examples

### Example 1: New Product with AI Only

Product has `allergens: ["gluten"]`, `freeFrom: ["milk"]`.

| Allergen | AI Base | Virtual 👍 | Virtual 👎 | Community | Score |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| gluten | contains | 0 | 2 | — | **0** |
| milk | free-from | 2 | 0 | — | **100** |
| soy | unknown | 1 | 1 | — | **50** |
| nuts | unknown | 1 | 1 | — | **50** |
| eggs | unknown | 1 | 1 | — | **50** |

- Universal safety = min(0, 100, 50, 50, 50) = **0**
- User avoiding `[gluten]` sees personalized safety = **0**
- User avoiding `[milk]` sees personalized safety = **100**
- User avoiding `[gluten, milk]` sees personalized safety = **0** (gluten is the bottleneck)

### Example 2: After Community Voting

Same product, after 20 community votes. Users discovered that despite "contains gluten" label, the product is actually celiac-safe (trace amounts only):

| Allergen | AI Base | Virtual | Community 👍 | Community 👎 | Score |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| gluten | contains | 0↑ 2↓ | 18 | 2 | **(0+18)/(0+2+18+2) = 82** |
| milk | free-from | 2↑ 0↓ | 12 | 0 | **(2+12)/(2+0+12+0) = 100** |
| soy | unknown | 1↑ 1↓ | 5 | 1 | **(1+5)/(1+1+5+1) = 75** |
| nuts | unknown | 1↑ 1↓ | 3 | 0 | **(1+3)/(1+1+3+0) = 80** |
| eggs | unknown | 1↑ 1↓ | 0 | 0 | **50** |

- Universal safety = min(82, 100, 75, 80, 50) = **50** (eggs is the limiting factor)
- User avoiding `[gluten]` sees: **82** (community overrode AI!)
- User avoiding `[milk, soy]` sees: min(100, 75) = **75**

### Example 3: Taste Score Progression

| After N Votes | Up | Down | Score |
|--------------|-----|------|-------|
| 0 votes | 0 | 0 | 50 |
| 1 👍 | 1 | 0 | 67 |
| 3 👍 | 3 | 0 | 80 |
| 3 👍 + 1 👎 | 3 | 1 | 67 |
| 10 👍 + 2 👎 | 10 | 2 | 79 |
| 50 👍 + 5 👎 | 50 | 5 | 89 |

## Design Rationale

### Why Per-Allergen Instead of Single Score?

A single safety score is meaningless when different users avoid different allergens. A product can be perfectly safe for someone with celiac disease but dangerous for someone with a nut allergy. Per-allergen scoring gives each user a **relevant** safety number.

### Why Bayesian Instead of Simple Average?

The Bayesian prior (virtual votes from AI) solves the **cold start problem**:
- New products with 0 community votes still have a reasonable score based on ingredient analysis
- The prior is weak enough that 5-10 community votes can shift the score significantly
- The prior never fully disappears, which means a product AI-classified as "contains" requires strong community evidence to reach "safe" — this is a safety-conscious design choice

### Why Thumbs Instead of Sliders?

1. **Cognitive load**: "Is this safe for [allergen]? 👍/👎" is faster than "Rate safety 0-100"
2. **Per-allergen granularity**: A slider for each of 5 allergens would be overwhelming
3. **Aggregation simplicity**: Counting thumbs is more robust than averaging subjective numbers
4. **Mobile UX**: Thumbs buttons are easier tap targets than sliders on small screens

### Why Lowest Score as Personalized Safety?

Allergic reactions are driven by the **worst-case** allergen, not the average. If a product is 100% safe for 4 of your allergens but 10% safe for 1, you should see 10%.
