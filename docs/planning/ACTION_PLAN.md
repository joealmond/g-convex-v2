# Action Plan

> **How to use this checklist:**
> 1. Pick the next unchecked `[ ]` item and mark it `[/]` (in progress)
> 2. When done, move it to `FINISHED_TASKS.md`
> 3. If a task **cannot be completed**, do NOT delete it — add a note explaining why (e.g., `[~] Blocked: reason`)
> 4. Keep this file as the **single source of truth** for what to do NEXT (Current Wave).
